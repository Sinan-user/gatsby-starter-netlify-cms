       <title>Sinan's Cat - The Legend!!!!!!!!</title>
     </head>
     <body>
     <h1> Sinan's cat was born the day after Sinan was born, and was immortal after being dropped in the Lake of Power in 2020 during the WORST OF YEARS!!!!! </h1>
     <h2> Birth Twinsies </h2> 
     <p>Sinan's mother was always begging for Brownies during her pregnancy cravings. But instead of asking for brownies she said upon Sinan's Birth, "I WANT 
     SOME BURGER KING!!!!!!" out of confusion, so because it was out of confusion and she got delirious and knocked over the Burger King while eating, and the kitten
     was brown, Sinan's parents decided to name her Brownie. </p>
     <h3> Loss and rediscovery </h3> <p>Later, Brownie would get Thanos zapped by Chuck Norris. Sinan would then annoy the crap out of Chuck Norris who would then file a restraining order. The press
     sided with Sinan, and Chuck Norris was canceled. Later, Brownie appeared as a kitten in Sinan's older sister's house, while she lived with her boyfriend.
     Sinan, having the traits of envy that he had as an enneagram 4 and a gamma male wanna be incel at the time, prayed to God that he would be the new owner of Brownie,
     "with minimal disruption" (good for you, Sinan, at least you have some ethics). It seemed like God did exist because after Sinan's nephew was born, (who was AWESOME!)
     he made so much noise that the cat shit everywhere and when a tree fell on Sinan's sister's house (ouch, God, that didn't seem like minimal disruption....I guess 
     its qismet.....). her two cats Brownie and Trashboat (don't ask....) stayed with Sinan's now deceased cat Louie (RIP). Suddenly Brownie stopped shitting, so the sis 
     agreed to give her to Sinan and his mother and brother. </p>
     <h4> Daily Life </h4> 
     <p> Brownie continued to shit and pee everywhere but we got that taken care of with some training pads, but she ate so much she got diabetes, but luckily she is healthy and
     safe with us and our insulin shots, and is OUR diabates cat. Or just OUR cat. And yes, my nephew plays with him, too, but because he's 3, we have to remind him to
     be gentle and not play when the cat is bothered by his playing. 
     She spends her time being scratched by a groomer brush, rubbing her own head and neck on it, sitting on a table with a blanket next to Sinan's aging mother as she
     watches netflix, drinking water from the upstairs abandoned master bedroom bathtub after waiting all day or a few hours for someone to come, getting rubs,
     often on the belly, exploring, among other things. For instance, she once had a friendship, or dare I say, "forbidden love?" (even though she's spayed) with an outdoor male
     cat through the windows, as everytime she turned her booty the male cat jumped on the windows, and she tried to get close to him too, but often got annoyed by his pushiness which may have ended
     the relationship.
     She wants to be watched while she eats often since she feels safer that way. </p> 
     <h5> Conclusion </h5> <p>
     Overall, she lives a happy and content life, but sadly she has lost her immortality due to eating kale. I told you to come watch Jim Gaffigan with me, Brownie.
     Just kidding, she was never immortal. But she will always live on in our hearts and minds, and in the words of Anne Frank, will continue to go on living after her death, 
     but luckily, we still have a few years with her. She is an amazing cat and we are lucky to have her. In other news, Jim Parsons owns Chuck Norris. If you don't get the reference you're not a true Big Bang Theory Fan.
